\begin{itemize}
\item Two paradigms for logic-based computation: proof search (logic programming) and proof reduction (functional programming).
      Understand the relationship between them.
\item Proof search allows very concise, expressive programs (e.g., [parallel] bubblesort in one line), but does not provide many (any?) guarantees.
      Proof reduction provides strong guarantees (e.g., preservation, progress, and termination), but requires the programmer to supply many details (e.g., bubblesort).
