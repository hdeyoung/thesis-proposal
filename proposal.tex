\title{Session-Typed Concurrent\\Logical Specifications}
\author{Henry DeYoung\\\texttt{hdeyoung@cs.cmu.edu}}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
% Concurrency arises naturally in a proof-construction-as-computation setting: if all interleavings of independent [proof] steps in a logical specification are treated as indistinguishable, then those steps appear to be concurrent. 
% Concurrency also arises naturally in a proof-reduction-as-computation setting: there is a Curry--Howard isomorphism between sequent proofs in intuitionistic linear logic and session-typed processes in the $\pi$-calculus.
% 
% Using session types as a bridge, we propose to identify a fragment of intuitionistic linear logic in which these two notions of concurrency coincide.
% Specifically, we propose to show that, given an assignment of message and process roles to atomic propositions, a class of concurrent linear logical specifications can be translated to session-typed processes.
% In addition to the practical benefits of generating well-typed implementations from logical specifications, the proposed work can be seen as giving a proof-theoretic reconstruction of work on global session types for multiparty communication, and furthering an understanding of connections between proof construction and proof reduction, despite their apparent disparity.
% 
% This document aims to establish the plausibility of justifies the proposed work's feasibility by carrying out the program in the simpler case of concurrent ordered logical specifications.

\noindent
% In computational interpretations of intuitionistic linear logic, two notions of concurrency arise.
Concurrency arises naturally in a proof-construction-as-computation interpretation of intuitionistic linear logic: if all interleavings of independent proof steps in a logical specification are treated as indistinguishable, then those steps appear to be concurrent. 
Concurrency also arises naturally in proof-reduction-as-computation: there is a Curry--Howard isomorphism, due to \citeauthor{Caires+Pfenning:CONCUR10}, between sequent proofs in intuitionistic linear logic and session-typed processes in the $\pi$-calculus.

In this proposal, we put forward the thesis that session types form a bridge between these two apparently disparate notions of concurrency.
Specifically, we propose to show that, given an assignment of process and message roles to atomic propositions, a class of concurrent linear logical specifications can be translated to session-typed processes.
In addition to the practical benefits of generating well-typed implementations from logical specifications, the proposed work can be seen as giving a proof-theoretic reconstruction of work on multiparty session types; as assigning behavioral types to a class of logical specifications, thereby ensuring deadlock freedom for those specifications; and as furthering an understanding of the relationship between proof construction and proof reduction.

This document aims to establish the thesis's plausibility by defending it in the restricted setting of intuitionistic ordered logic.
% We show that a class of concurrent ordered logical specifications can be translated to session-typed processes.
The primary area of proposed research will then be to relax that restriction, extending the ideas in this document to linear logic.
