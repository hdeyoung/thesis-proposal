\section{Background: Concurrent ordered logic programming}\label{sec:ordered-lp}

Viewed through a computational lens, proof search in a fragment of ordered logic becomes a forward-chaining logic programming language~\autocite{Pfenning+Simmons:LICS09}.
It can be seen as a logically motivated generalization of string rewriting~\autocite[see, \eg,][]{Book+Otto:SRS93}, an analogy which we will exploit to provide some intuition for this form of ordered logic programming.

From the perspective of string rewriting, an ordered logic program's atomic propositions are letters; ordered conjunctions (or ordered contexts) of these atoms are strings; and, under a focused proof search strategy~\autocite{Andreoli:JLC92}, the ordered implications that serve as program clauses are string rewriting rules.
An example will help to clarify.
