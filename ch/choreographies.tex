\section{Choreographies}\label{sec:choreographies}

Traditionally, concurrency is phrased as the composition of interacting, \wc{locally executing}[\st{distributed}] processes.
As the binary counter example from \cref{sec:exampl-binary-count-2,sec:exampl-binary-count-3} demonstrates, a notion of concurrency based on indistinguishable interleavings of independent rewrites arises naturally in ordered logic programming.
% a notion of concurrency based on indestinguishable interleavings arises naturally in ordered logic programming.
% However, it is not as clear how to identify a notion of process
But where are the \wc{locally executing}[\st{distributed}] processes?

Taking a formula-as-process view \autocites{Miller:ELP92}{Cervesato+Scedrov:IC09}, the processes are the ordered logic program's atomic propositions.
% This thesis proposes that the atomic propositions in an ordered logic program are the processes.
% \fxnote{[How much of this is already implied by a formula-as-process interpretation?]}%
The program's clauses, accordingly, serve to specify the valid interactions among processes. 
In the binary counter,
% \wc{specification}[\st{program}], 
for example, $\eps$, $\bit{0}$, $\bit{1}$, and $\inc$, among others,
% $\dec$, $\bit[']{0}$, $\zero$, and $\succ$ 
are
% all 
atoms-as-processes,
% whose interactions are governed by the program's rules.
% In particular, the rule
and the clause
\begin{equation*}
  \bit{1} \fuse \inc \lrimp \monad{\inc \fuse \bit{0}}
\end{equation*}
% says that neighboring $\bit{1}$ and $\inc$ processes \fxnote{should be able to} interact to form neighboring $\inc$ and $\bit{0}$ processes.
says that one valid interaction is for neighboring $\bit{1}$ and $\inc$ processes to \wc{coordinate}[\st{cooperate}] to become neighboring $\inc$ and $\bit{0}$ processes.
% (with similar readings for the other clauses).

The program's clauses don't tell the full story, however:
the clauses specify\fxnote{\ globally} \emph{what} are valid interactions but not \emph{how} to realize \wc{them}[\st{those interactions}]\fxnote{\ \st{locally}}.
% The program is thus only a \vocab{specification}, with the how instead being supplied by the logic programming language's operational semantics.
In ordered logic programming, the how is\fxnote{\ \st{instead}} traditionally supplied by an operational semantics in which a\fxnote{\st{n omniscient}} central conductor, having the benefit of a global view of all atoms, directs the atoms' interactions according to the program's clauses.
% The how is instead supplied by the language's operational semantics.
% % The  language's operational semantics instead supplies the how.
% % The program is thus only a \vocab{specification}, with
% In the usual operational semantics for ordered logic programming, there is a central \enquote{conductor} who, having the benefit of a global view of all atoms, directs the atoms' interactions according to the program's clauses.
But because they rely so heavily on the central conductor, processes using this semantics are no more than superficially \wc{local}[\st{distributed}].
% Under this semantics, however, processes are only nominally distributed because they rely so heavily on the central conductor.


To be truly \wc{local}[\st{distributed}], the processes should instead communicate directly with their neighbors to identify which, if any, of the valid interactions are possible for them at that moment.
% For instance, by communicating directly with its left-hand neighbor, an $\inc$ process might learn that that neighbor is a $\bit{1}$ process and that the above clause therefore applies; further direct communication between the two processes would effect
For instance, by communicating directly with its left-hand neighbor, an $\inc$ process might learn that that neighbor is a $\bit{1}$ process; with further direct communication, the $\bit{1}$ and $\inc$ processes could coordinate to effect the above\fxnote{\ globally specified} interaction.
% How does $\bit{1}$, for example, learn that its right-hand neighbor is $\inc$ and that the above clause therefore applies?


So, the distinction being drawn here is one between a \vocab{specification} and its \vocab{choreography}---the what and the how.
% \fxnote{\st{The original program is only a specification of the valid process interactions, whereas a choreography is a pattern of communication that implements that specification.}}
A specification is the original program, which serves as a \emph{global} description of the valid process interactions; a choreography is a \emph{local}\fxnote{\ message-passing} implementation of that specification.%

% Designing a one-size-fits-all distributed operational semantics appears to be difficult, however.
% We could try to design a one-size-fits-all local operational semantics, but this appears to be difficult.
Ideally, an operational semantics would automatically generate a choreography from the specification supplied by the programmer, but designing such a semantics\fxnote{\ \st{unfortunately}} appears to be difficult.

% % Designing a uniformly suitable distributed operational semantics appears to be difficult, however.
Different specifications will often require different patterns of interprocess communication;
sometimes a specification will even admit several choreographies, and, more often than not, the programmer will want to exercise control in those cases.

In the previous \lcnamecref{sec:??}, we saw several examples of specifications (characterized as forward-chaining ordered logic programs), including the aforementioned binary counter supporting increment and decrement operations.
We'll now describe what counts as a choreography, first with informal examples and then with formal definitions.
