    <h1>Session-Typed Concurrent Logical Specifications</h1>

    <p>Concurrency arises naturally in a proof-construction-as-computation interpretation of intuitionistic linear logic: if all interleavings of independent proof steps in a logical specification are treated as indistinguishable, then those steps appear to be concurrent.  Concurrency also arises naturally in proof-reduction-as-computation: there is a Curryâ€“Howard isomorphism, due to Caires and Pfenning, between sequent proofs in intuitionistic linear logic and session-typed processes in the pi-calculus.</p>
    <p>In this proposal, we put forward the thesis that session types form a bridge between these two apparently disparate notions of concurrency.  Specifically, we propose to show that, given an assignment of process and message roles to atomic propositions, a class of concurrent linear logical specifications can be translated to session-typed processes.  In addition to the practical benefits of generating well-typed implementations from logical specifications, the proposed work can be seen as giving a proof-theoretic reconstruction of work on multiparty session types; as assigning behavioral types to a class of logical specifications, thereby ensuring deadlock freedom for those specifications; and as furthering an understanding of the relationship between proof construction and proof reduction.</p>
    <p>This document aims to establish the thesis's plausibility by defending it in the restricted setting of intuitionistic ordered logic.  The primary area of proposed research will then be to relax that restriction, extending the ideas in this document to linear logic.</p>
