  abstract = {The deep symmetry of linear logic makes it suitable for providing abstract models of computation, free from implementation details which are, by nature, oriented and non-symmetrical.  I propose here one such model, in the area of logic programming, where the basic computational principle is Computation = Proof search.  Proofs considered here are those of the Gentzen style sequent calculus for linear logic.  However, proofs in this system may be redundant, in that two proofs can be syntactically different although identical up to some irrelevant reordering or simplification of the applications of the inferences rules.  This leads to an intractable proof search where the search procedure is forced to make costly choices which turn out to be irrelevant.  To overcome this problem, a subclass of proofs, called the `focusing' proofs, which is both complete (any derivable formula in linear logic has a focusing proof) and tractable (many irrelevant choices in the search are eliminated when aimed at focusing proofs) is identified.  The main constraint underlying the specification of focusing proofs has been to preserve the symmetry of linear logic, which is its most salient feature.  In particular, dual connectives have dual properties with respect to focusing proofs.  Then, a programming language, called LinLog, consisting of a fragment of linear logic, in which focusing proofs have a more compact form, is presented.  LinLog deals with formulae which have a syntax similar to the of the definite clauses and goals of Horn logic, but the crucial difference here is that it allows clauses with multiple atoms in the head, connected by the `par' (multiplicative disjunction).  It is then shown that the syntactic restriction induced by LinLog is not performed at the cost of any expressive power: a mapping from full linear logic to LinLog, preserving focusing proofs, and analogous to the normalization to clausal form for classical logic, is presented.}

Our construction yields a clean and elegant formulation that accounts for a rich set of multiplicative, additive, and exponential connectives, extending dual intuitionistic linear logic but differing from both classical linear logic and Hyland and de Paiva's full intuitionistic linear logic.  We also provide a corresponding sequent calculus that admits a simple proof of the admissibility of cut by a single structural induction.  Finally, we show how to interpret classical linear logic (with or without the MIX rule) in our system, employing a form of double-negation translation.}

  abstract = {A proof-theoretic characterization of logical languages that form suitable bases for Prolog-like programming languages is provided.  This characterization is based on the principle that the declarative meaning of a logic program, provided by provability in a logical system, should coincide with its operational meaning, provided by interpreting logical connectives as simple and fixed search instructions.  The operational semantics is formalized by the identification of a class of cut-free sequent proofs called uniform proofs.  A uniform proof is one that can be found by a goal-directed search that respects the interpretation of the logical connectives as search instructions.  The concept of a uniform proof is used to define the notion of an abstract logic programming language, and it is shown that first-order and higher-order Horn clauses with classical provability are examples of such a language.  Horn clauses are then generalized to hereditary Harrop formulas and it is shown that first-order and higher-order versions of this new class of formulas are also abstract logic programming languages if the inference rules are those of either intuitionistic or minimal logic.  The programming language significance of the various generalizations to first-order Horn clauses is briefly discussed.}

  abstract = {Plotkin's $\lambda_\nu$-calculus for call-by-value programs is weaker than the $\lambda\beta\eta$-calculus for the same programs in continuation-passing style (CPS). To identify the call-by-value axioms that correspond to $\beta\eta$ on CPS terms, we define a new CPS transformation and an inverse mapping, both of which are interesting in their own right. Using the new CPS transformation, we determine the precise language of CPS terms closed under $\beta\eta$-transformations, as well as the call-by-value axioms that correspond to the so-called administrative $\beta\eta$-reductions on CPS terms. Using the inverse mapping, we map the remaining $\beta$ and $\eta$ equalities on CPS terms to axioms on call-by-value terms. On the pure (constant free) set of $\Lambda$-terms, the resulting set of axioms is equivalent to Moggi's computational $\lambda$-calculus. If the call-by-value language includes the control operators abort and call-with-current-continuation, the axioms are equivalent to an extension of Felleisen et al.'s $\lambda_\nu$-C-calculus and to the equational subtheory of Talcott's logic IOCC.}

The keys to our approach are (1) an adaptation of subject reduction theorems from combinatory logic to programming languages, and (2) the use of rewriting techniques for the specification of the language semantics.  The approach easily extends from polymorphic functional languages to imperative languages that provide references, exceptions, continuations, and similar features.  We illustrate the technique with a type soundness theorem for the core of Standard ML, which includes the first type soundness proof for polymorphic exceptions and continuations.}
