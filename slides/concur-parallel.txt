"Concurrency is not Parallelism", Talk by Rob Pike
<http://concur.rspace.googlecode.com/hg/talk/concur.html>

  + Concurrency is about design and structure; parallelism is about
    execution

      - Concurrency = composition of independently executing processes

      - Parallelism = simultaneous execution of (possibly related)
        "computations"

      - Concurrent designs may or may not be parallelizable.

  + Example of gophers incinerating outdated manuals

      - Design #1: Gopher A loads books onto cart, gopher B unloads
        books from cart, and gopher C transports carts back and forth
        between A and B.

      - Design #2: Add gopher D that also transports carts back and
        forth between A and B.  While C is going forth, D is going
        back; and vice versa.

      - Design #2 adds a gopher (concurrent procedure) to the design,
        which complicates the design but also makes it more
        parallelizable.

  + Concurrency = nondeterministic compostion of programs;
    parallelism = asymptotic efficiency of deterministic programs.

      - "Parallelism is all about dependencies among the
        subcomputations of a deterministic computation."

      - "Parallelism is a useful abstraction, and abstractions should
        never be confused with their implementations."

  + Concurrent scheduling is nondeterministic and competitive;
    parallel scheduling is deterministic and cooperative.


Discussion with Frank

  Concurrency (CLF, pi-calculus)
    - nondeterministic scheduling
    - competitive scheduling
    - nondeterministic result
    - Either interleaved or true concurrent semantics

  Deterministic/confluent concurrency (SILL)
    - nondeterministic scheduling
    - noncompetitive (but not exactly "cooperative") scheduling
    - deterministic result

  Parallelism (NESL)
    - deterministic scheduling
    - cooperative scheduling
    - deterministic result
    - Interleaved semantics is awkward
